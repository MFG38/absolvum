ABSOLVUM'S TEXTURE NAMING CONVENTION
====================================

Textures are named following a fairly simple convention: the first 2 letters
determine the color of the texture (see prefix list below), and the rest of them
determine the "type". This convention was put in place to make grouping and using
the textures as easy as possible. All texture names are a maximum of 8 letters long
in order to keep with the DOOM texture naming convention.
